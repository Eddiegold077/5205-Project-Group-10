**Research Questions**  
Research Question 1:
Based on demographic, clinical, and physiological parameters in this dataset, what are the most significant predictors of heart disease? How do these factors interact with each other to influence the overall risk?

Research Question 2:
Can patients be classified effectively into distinct groups with different cardiovas- cular risk characteristics through cluster analysis, and what specific combinations characteristics distinguish these clusters?

Research Question 3:
Utilizing the classification method to the whole participants, are we able to predict the probability of developing heart disease with better accuracy?  

**Focus and prioritize your intended plans for analysis.** 
Incorporate the feedback you receive from the teaching staff on the Proposal.  Try to limit your work to a smaller number of analyses that you can do well and explore deeply rather than touching on many separate topics.

**Build a draft of the initial analyses.**  
  
**Evaluate and scrutinize the results.**
How well can you answer your questions?  How accurate are the results on the scale of the problem? 

**Revise your analyses.**   
What should be changed to reflect your initial findings? What more is needed to better understand the problem?

**Report your conclusions.**   
Draft a document that places the problem in the proper context. Describe your analyses in language and technical details that are appropriate for your intended audience. Decide what kind of results to include.

**Recommendations.**  
Place your conclusions in the context of the domain or application. What should be done differently? What specific choices should decision-makers consider? What kinds of improvements are likely, and how can you quantify them? Keep in mind that not every observed difference (e.g. demographic differences) is directly actionable. As much as possible, frame your analysis to reflect choices that are within the control of your intended audience.
