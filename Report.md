**Research Questions**  
Research Question 1:
Based on demographic, clinical, and physiological parameters in this dataset, what are the most significant predictors of heart disease? How do these factors interact with each other to influence the overall risk?

Research Question 2:
Can patients be classified effectively into distinct groups with different cardiovascular risk characteristics through cluster analysis, and what specific combinations characteristics distinguish these clusters?

Research Question 3:
Utilizing the classification method to the whole participants, are we able to predict the probability of developing heart disease with better accuracy?  

**Focus and prioritize your intended plans for analysis.** 
Incorporate the feedback you receive from the teaching staff on the Proposal.  Try to limit your work to a smaller number of analyses that you can do well and explore deeply rather than touching on many separate topics.

**Build a draft of the initial analyses.**  
  
**Evaluate and scrutinize the results.**
How well can you answer your questions?  How accurate are the results on the scale of the problem? 

**Revise your analyses.**   
What should be changed to reflect your initial findings? What more is needed to better understand the problem?

**Report your conclusions.**   
Draft a document that places the problem in the proper context. Describe your analyses in language and technical details that are appropriate for your intended audience. Decide what kind of results to include.

**Recommendations.**  
As for the general public, public health education should be strengthened to make sure they understand the primary risk factors that may lead to heart disease. Additionally, individuals should be encouraged to use personal health monitoring tools and have regular health examination to help proactively track and manage their health indicators. 

Moreover, the healthcare providers can identify the high-risk populations based on our clustering analysis result. Applying regular screening among this group of populations could lead to early detection and timely intervention, which help to slow disease progression and reduce their potential health care costs. Utilize the prediction model created from this research can promote the development of personalized treatments. The application of a personalized medicine approach in the clinic allows real-time assessment of patient risk as the technology can provide dynamic and personalized treatment plans, thereby reducing the incidence rate of CVDs in high-risk populations.

While the current heart dataset provides a foundation for cardiovascular disease research, we still need to expand the heart dataset in the future to integrate more longitudinal and real-time patient data from wearable technologies. This expansion could enrich the dataset and allow researchers to observe how a patient's condition changes over time and improve the understanding of disease progression and tracking the impact of various interventions. As the wearable technologies can track the dynamic data and provide real-time monitoring, which significantly improving predictive models. Moreover, itâ€™s necessary to enhance the analysis capabilities for further research, utilizing the deep learning techniques can potentially provide deeper insights and improve the accuracy of the prediction results. 

In conclusion, this study leveraged advanced analytics and machine learning techniques to comprehensively analyze the importance of heart disease risk factors and the complexity of their interactions. The outcomes of the research are expected to improve the accuracy of the heart disease predictions and provide targeted interventions for high-risk populations based on cluster analysis. By promoting early detection and personalized treatment strategies, the incidence rate of CVDs and economic burden can be effectively reduced. This approach aligns with modern trends of personalized medicine and leverages the advantages of technology integration to strengthen health management strategies.
